# Nightmare Navigator

The Nightmare Navigator is a tool used to discover the latest horror films via a Telegram Bot named "nightmare_navigator bot". By sending the message "movies" to the bot, users receive the 20 most recent horror films. For instance, typing "3 sci-fi movies 01.01.15" fetches the three latest sci-fi horror films from the date 01.01.15. Additionally, users can search using keywords "fantasy" and "thriller". Only films with an IMDb rating higher than 5 are displayed, while those belonging to the Adventure, History, Family, Romance, Documentary, and Music genres are filtered out.
